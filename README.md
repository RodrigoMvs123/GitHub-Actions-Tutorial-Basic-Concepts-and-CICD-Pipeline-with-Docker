Syntax

Java App  with Grandle    ->   Docker Image   ->  Private Repository 
Build Artifact                            Build Image            Push Docker repo

What are GitHub Actions?
Platform to automate developer workflows
CI/CD Workflow 

What are those workflows ?
Github 
Platform for open-source projects
Publically available to use and contribute to the project 
Add new contributors
Pull requests are created 

Issues
Pull Requests
Merge to master branch 

CI/CD Pipeline 
Merged Code / Test / Build / Deployment 

How GitHub Actions automate these workflows ?
When somethings happens In or To your repository 
Automatic ACTIONS are executed in response 

Listen to Events 
PR Created / Contr. joined / Other apps / Issue created / PR merged 

Trigger Workflow 
Issue created

            Sort             - Action
Label            - Action
Assign It       - Action 
Reproduce   - Action 

CI/CD with GitHub Actions 
Most common workflow for your repository 
Commit code / Test / Build / Push / Deploy 

Pipeline / Node.js App / Build Docker Image / push to Nexus Repo / Deploy to DigitalOcean Server 

Pipeline / Java App with Maven / Integrations Tests Linux and Windows / Build Docker Image / push to AWS Repo / deploy to AWS EKS
